Requirements
============
Install package 'sklearn ' as follow :
$ pip install scikit-learn --user

Install package 'skimage ' as follow :
$ pip install scikit-image --user

Code organization
=================
Our_VGG16.py - contains our VGG base architecture
Training.ipynb - trains the model to reproduce loss graphs as in Figure 4-8
predict.py - To run on the test data to get bounding boxes as in figure 9-15
yolo_loss.py - It is the separate python file to deal with loss function for the model
demo . ipynb -- Run a demo of our code ###( reproduce Figure 3 of our report )
config.py -- contains global variables and paths to change

[Demo_image01/2/3/4] -- output images of demo.ipynb
voc2012test - test ground truth annotations
voc2007test - train ground truth annotations
